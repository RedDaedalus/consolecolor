# Console Color
This is a small repository for a console coloring utility class used in some of my projects. This system supports the set of `16` ANSI colors: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, and white, along with their bright variants.

## Example Usage
```java
System.out.println(ConsoleColor.RED.embolden() + "This message is bright red!");
```
